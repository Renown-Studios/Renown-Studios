what tools do we use?
- our code is all here on github or on our subsidiary (for minecraft specific things) NotRedacted
- our file-sharing system is google drive. we heavily recommend this to others as it is simple, easy to use and allows for simple collaboration
- our communications platform is on discord
- our development software is visual studio, JetBrains Java IDE, Eclipse, Unity Game engine, and Unreal Engine 

why do we share what tools we use
- we don't want to gatekeep info :)

will all of our projects be open-source
- we know that people are weary of what they use, so our projects will mostly be open-source, specifically our modifications. HOWEVER, our games, coming in the future, will NOT be open-source.
